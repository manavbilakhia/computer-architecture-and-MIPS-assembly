# Lab 8: Bubble sort

# Setup

- Read through `bubble_sort.c` and/or search google to familiarize yourself with the bubble sort algorithm
- Download the starter code `bubble_sort.s`

# Bubble sort in Assembly

The C++ code for bubble sort is a useful starting point. Translate it into assembly-language and test it.

Some notes:

- The `bubblesort` routine must be a subroutine called from the main program. The starter code passes in the required arguments.
- initialize your array with hand-picked random values, both positive and negative.
- When your routine works, which you can see by looking at the array after the call to sort it, such that the values are sorted inside data memory
- Grab a snapshot of your output window before and after the run, and in each case, highlight the portion of the data area that holds the array. Grab a snapshot of the output of the console too.

# Hand in:
- a PDF report containing a brief written description of each of your programs, alongside before-and-after screenshots
- your working `bubble_sort.s` program
